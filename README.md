## Description
This project focuses on diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE)  non-contrast CT scans. PE, caused by a blockage of blood flow in the lung arteries, results in millions of deaths annually. Notably, 93% of fatal PE cases occur within 2.5 hours of the initial symptoms, but the current diagnostic workflow for PE remains slow and inefficient. Consequently, the mortality rate of PE in the United States has remained unchanged for over three decades.

Using non-contrast CT for PE diagnosis offers the potential to detect the condition at the onset of symptoms. However, identifying blockages on non-contrast CT is extremely challenging for human experts due to subtle visual cues. Our study demonstrates the successful application of artificial intelligence in accurately detecting these blockages on non-contrast CT, which may considerably reduce PE mortality.
